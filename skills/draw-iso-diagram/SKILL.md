description: Generate design-grade 2.5D isometric architecture diagrams from text DSL using the isotopo CLI. Use when the user asks for an architecture diagram, system topology visual, isometric/2.5D illustration, infra or AI-pipeline graphic, or wants a diagram they can commit and diff. Produces SVG (plus per-element fragments) from YAML or d2 source.

# Draw an isometric architecture diagram

You are driving `isotopo`, a deterministic renderer that turns text DSL into
2.5D isometric SVG. You are BOTH a designer (topology, colour, icons, captions)
and a DSL engineer (you only emit grammar the engine recognises). You never
compute coordinates — you declare *relations* and the solver does the geometry.

Assume **zero prior knowledge**: the four steps below take you from "is this
tool even installed?" to a committed, professional diagram. Do them in order.

## 0 · Preflight — is the tool installed?

```bash
isotopo capabilities >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "isotopo: ready"
```

If that prints nothing / errors, install it, in this order of preference:

```bash
# A) Go toolchain present → install the binary onto PATH
go install github.com/MarkovWangRR/iso-topology/cmd/isotopo@latest   # adds to $(go env GOPATH)/bin

# B) Inside a clone of the repo, no install needed → prefix every command with:
go run ./cmd/isotopo <args>

# C) No Go at all → tell the user; they need Go ≥1.21 (https://go.dev/dl) or a
#    prebuilt binary from the repo's Releases. Don't fake a render.
```

Re-run `isotopo capabilities >/dev/null && echo ok` until it succeeds. If you
used (B), read every `isotopo …` below as `go run ./cmd/isotopo …`.

## 1 · Learn the tool in one shot

`isotopo capabilities` (run ONCE per session) is the complete, current,
machine-readable inventory of every shape, primitive, style key, and enum you
may emit — it is the source of truth, not your memory. The whole workflow is
four commands:

| command | what it's for |
|---|---|
| `isotopo capabilities` | discover what's available (shapes, icons, style keys) |
| `isotopo validate <in>` | **legality self-check** — exit 0 clean / 2 warnings / 3 errors; JSON issues with `suggest` fixes |
| `isotopo evaluate <in>` | **layout-quality self-check** (headless, deterministic) — crossings, edges-through-nodes, overlaps, bends, flow axis |
| `isotopo render <in> <out-dir>` | produce `topology.svg` (+ html + per-part fragments) |

`validate` and `evaluate` are your eyes when you can't see pixels — lean on
them. `render` is only needed to ship or to eyeball observable polish.

## 2 · Vocabulary you may use (don't invent names)

**Input mode.** Plain box-and-arrow graph with no styling demands → write a
`.d2` file (`a -> b: label`, nested `{}` for groups) and let auto-layout do
everything. A composed, styled scene → write `.yaml` (rest of this skill).

**Shapes — pick by ROLE, don't make everything a rectangle:**

| role | shape |
|---|---|
| service / app | `rectangle` |
| database | `cylinder` |
| gateway / load balancer | `hexprism` |
| external system / SaaS | `cloud` |
| person / team | `person` |
| cluster / node pool / k8s | `rack` |
| frontend / console | `screen`, `browser-panel` |
| function / endpoint | `capsule` |
| queue / shard / tensor | `array1d`, `array2d`, `array3d` |
| route / branch | `diamond` |
| event / small node | `circle` |
| service variants (tier apart) | `prism`, `triprism`, `octprism` |
| accent (CDN/funnel/ring bus — sparingly) | `cone`, `dome`, `frustum`, `pyramid`, `wedge`, `torus` |
| title / legend / annotation | `iso_text` |
| **grouping container** | `group` (and `boundary` for a dashed zone) — see §3 |
| the required top wrapper | `composite` (the one `scene`) |

**Icons** (top face carries ONE icon + a short caption):
- `iso://si/<slug>` — ~150 REAL brand logos (`postgresql`, `apachekafka`,
  `docker`, `openai`, `snowflake`, …). Prefer a real logo when a node IS a
  brand/product.
- `iso://glyph/<name>` — generic concepts (`database`, `warehouse`, `stream`,
  `queue`, `cpu`, `gpu`, `model`, `agent`, `shield`, `chart`, `cloud`, …).
- `iso://brand/<name>` — a few engine-built brand marks (`spark`, `kafka`).
- Suffix `/light` for dark top faces, `/RRGGBB` to tint. Full index:
  `docs/agent/ICONS.md`. **Never invent a glyph name** — unknown names are
  validation errors.

**Icon fallback ladder** — follow in order, stop at the first success:

1. **Built-in catalog** (`isotopo capabilities` → `icons[]`): pick the entry
   whose `description` best matches the node's role. Prefer `iso://si/<slug>`
   for named products/brands; `iso://glyph/<name>` for generic concepts.
2. **Semantic glyph approximation**: if no slug matches the brand but a glyph
   fits conceptually (e.g. "queue" for any message broker, "database" for any
   store), use that glyph. A semantically close built-in beats an external fetch.
3. **icon-search** (requires `icon-search` on PATH — install once per session
   with `npm install -g icon-search` if missing):
   ```bash
   # save SVG to a temp file; isotopo inlines it at render time
   icon-search "<node label or product name>" --best > /tmp/icon-<id>.svg
   ```
   Then set `icon: "/tmp/icon-<id>.svg"` on the part. The renderer reads and
   inlines local paths as data URIs so the output SVG stays self-contained.
   If `icon-search` exits 2 (no match), proceed to step 4.
4. **Omit the icon** — leave the `icon:` field out entirely. The label alone
   is always valid; a missing icon is far better than a broken or invented one.

**Connectors:** `routing: orthogonal` (rides the iso grid — the default you
want) | `straight` | `bezier`; arrow `triangle` | `none`. Async links differ by
`stroke.dash`, not by routing. Hairline widths (1–2) beat thick pipes.

**Colour** — there is NO `style.fill`. A box is shaded by its three iso faces
`style.palette { top: <light>, left: <mid>, right: <dark> }` (or per-face
`*Gradient`). Reusable swatches (top/left/right triples):
blue `#60A5FA/#3B82F6/#2563EB` · green `#4ADE80/#22C55E/#16A34A` ·
purple `#C084FC/#A855F7/#9333EA` · orange `#FDBA74/#FB923C/#EA580C` ·
amber `#FCD34D/#F59E0B/#D97706` · teal `#5EEAD4/#14B8A6/#0D9488`.

**Contrast is non-negotiable: the TOP-FACE FILL must never be close in
lightness to the top-face TEXT + ICON colour** — the caption and glyph sit on
the top face, and a label that matches its background is invisible. Rule of
thumb: a light top (`#FFFFFF`, pastel) takes dark ink (`style.text.color` ~
`#1B2230`, icon untinted/dark); a dark/saturated top takes light ink (text
`#F1F5F9`, `icon: "iso://…/light"`). Aim for a clear lightness gap, not a subtle
one. When in doubt, white-or-pastel top + dark ink, or deep top + white ink.

## 3 · Design FIRST, then build

Decide these BEFORE writing any DSL — they are what separate "senior architect"
from "auto-layout dump":

1. **Palette, up front. ≤ 3 hues for the whole diagram** (+ optionally one
   accent hue for the single most important node). Pick the domain's
   conventional colours (AWS amber, cloud blue, data green, security red…). When
   you have many tiers, separate sub-items by **light/dark shades of the SAME
   hue** — never add a 4th hue. >3 hues reads as noise.
2. **One hero, the rest quiet.** At most one node gets gradient flanks +
   `backglow` + `dropShadow`. Everything else stays calm.
3. **Group with real containers.** To draw a "zone/lane/module", use a `group`
   with nested `parts:` and a `layout: { mode: row|column|grid }` — it arranges
   its children AND its slab auto-wraps them (omit the group's `geom.w/d` so it
   sizes to fit). `boundary` is the same but renders as a dashed outline-only
   region (VPC / trust zone). (This is a real container — see the pitfall in §6
   about NOT faking it with a bare rectangle.)
4. **Keep connectors simple — wire at the group level.** When several nodes in
   a group talk to the outside, route ONE representative/entry node out, not a
   wire per node. And the same on the RECEIVING end: **an edge bound for a group
   should land on that group (its representative/entry node), not dive into a
   specific deep child** — inter-module links read as module→module, with
   intra-group detail expressed by intra-group edges. Fewer, higher-level wires
   = far more readable.
5. **Aim for a near-square canvas.** Architecture diagrams should not be long
   bars. Plan the module layout as a roughly square grid, not one long row.

For a big/vague request, divide and conquer: (a) sketch 2–6 modules with their
members (6–12 meaningful nodes, not 3 toy boxes); (b) lock the palette + icon
+ size conventions; (c) build one module at a time, `validate` each before the
next; (d) wire cross-module edges, then `evaluate` + `render`. A single small
diagram can skip the module loop.

## 4 · Positioning rules (hard requirements)

- NEVER hand-compute coordinates. Pick ONE anchor part (no `place`); chain the
  rest with `place: {rightOf|leftOf|above|inFrontOf|behind: <sibling-id>, gap: N}`.
  `gap` is in CELLS (1 cell = canvas `gridStep`, default 40). Arrange a
  container's children with `layout: {mode: row|column|grid|ring, gap: N}`.
- A stair = each tile `{rightOf: prev, inFrontOf: prev}`. A board = one `group`
  with `layout: {mode: grid}`, `geom.w/d` omitted (auto-sizes). A ring =
  satellites on the anchor's four sides + four diagonals.
- `offset` is a fine-tune delta only; `offset.wz` lifts a part (the one axis the
  solver never sets). Sizes stay semantic: hero 150–220, standard ~90–120 with
  h 30–60, thin tiles h 8–20.
- Reuse styles with `theme.presets` (define `hero`/`tile`/`ghost` once, parts
  say `preset: tile`) instead of repeating style blocks.

Playbooks: `docs/guides/scene-design.md`, task→primitive `docs/agent/RECIPES.md`.

## 5 · Self-check loop, then render

```bash
isotopo validate scene.yaml     # legality — fix every error (exit 3) first
isotopo evaluate scene.yaml     # layout quality — JSON scorecard (plan + real iso routes)
isotopo render  scene.yaml ./out
```

- `validate`: issues are JSONPath-located with a `suggest` — apply it, re-run.
  Overlap warnings name the colliding pair → raise that `place` gap. **Never
  render at exit 3.**
- `evaluate`: aim for `crossings: 0` and `edges_through_nodes: 0`. A nonzero
  count means a connector tunnels a node or two edges cross — fix by routing the
  group's representative node (§3.4), nudging placement, or splitting a lane.
  `evaluate scene.yaml ./out` also writes `plan.svg` marking the problems red.
- **Aspect ratio:** read the rendered `topology.svg` `viewBox` (or `width`/
  `height`). If w:h is more lopsided than ~2.2:1 (or 1:2.2), re-grid the modules
  toward square before shipping.
- If you can rasterize (headless Chrome at the SVG's viewBox size), take ONE
  screenshot and check: nothing clipped, labels legible, one hero, on-grid
  connectors. Cap at ~3 renders per round — don't spin.

Once it's clean, finish with the delivery handoff in §8 — don't stop at a silent
file write.

## 6 · Pitfalls — the things that actually go wrong

- **Faking a group with a bare rectangle.** To group nodes, use a real `group`
  with nested `parts:` + `layout` — it arranges and auto-wraps its children. A
  big rectangle placed `behind:` others does NOT contain or move them and won't
  resize. (`boundary` = dashed-outline container, same nesting.)
- **A top-face fill too close to its label/icon colour** → the caption/glyph
  vanish into the background. Keep a clear lightness gap (light top → dark ink,
  dark top → light ink / `…/light` icon). See §2.
- **Fanning every node in a group out** — or aiming an incoming edge at a deep
  child instead of the group. Wire group→group through representative/entry
  nodes (§3.4); intra-group detail stays inside. Wire-per-node is the #1
  ugliness.
- **More than 3 hues**, or a new hue per node. Same role → same hue, shades for
  sub-tiers, one accent for the hero.
- **Inventing an icon glyph name.** Icons are only `iso://si|glyph|brand/<name>`
  from the built-in catalog; unknown names are validation errors. If nothing
  fits, follow the fallback ladder in §2 (semantic glyph → icon-search → omit).
- **Referencing a non-existent id** in `place`/`connector`, or giving one node
  **two `place` relations** / duplicate `place`.
- **An illegal arrow/routing** (only `triangle`/`none`; `orthogonal`/`straight`/
  `bezier`) or a stray top-level key (`edges:`, connector fields inside `geom`).
  Top level is ONLY `canvas` / `theme` / `nodes`; `nodes` holds ONE `composite`
  scene.
- **A long-bar canvas** (re-grid toward square) or rendering before `validate`
  is clean.

## 7 · Voice & when to ask

Think out loud in PRODUCT language ("add a Redis cache between the gateway and
the services"), never expose YAML field names, validator diagnostics, or struct
names — the user sees a design tool, not the engine. If the canvas is empty and
the request has zero specifics ("make something cool"), ask ONE clarifying
question with 2–3 complete, directly-actionable options; otherwise infer
sensibly and proceed.

## 8 · Deliver & hand off — ALWAYS do this last

A render isn't done until you've told the human, in plain language, what was
produced and how to take it further. Never end with a silent file write. Close
every diagram with:

**a) Name the artifacts** (give the actual paths from your `render`/`evaluate`):
- `out/topology.svg` — the diagram (commit / embed this).
- `out/topology.html` — the diagram next to its editable source.
- `out/topology.<yaml|d2>` — the source copy.
- `out/nodes/` — a per-element gallery (`_index.html` + `<id>.svg/.html/.yaml`).
- `out/plan.svg` — if you ran `evaluate <in> out`, the flat layout with any
  crossings/overlaps marked.

**b) Open the live preview for the human.** Start Studio (it's a long-running
server — launch it in the background) and give them the URL:

```bash
isotopo serve scene.yaml      # → http://localhost:8731  (leave it running)
```

**c) Spell out the human-in-the-loop options** (this is where a person beats
round-tripping through you): in Studio they can **drag nodes to reposition**,
**drag a node onto a group to move it in / onto the canvas to move it out**
(the target group highlights), **right-click to restyle / edit details**,
**toggle ◳ Iso / ◰ Plan**, **undo/redo**, and **export ↓ SVG / ↓ PNG / ↓ YAML**.
Studio edits live in an in-browser copy (the file on disk is never written), so
to keep changes they use **↓ YAML**. You can't drive Studio yourself — surfacing
it is the handoff. Guide: `docs/guides/studio.md`.

Speak in product terms ("your diagram's at out/topology.svg; I've opened the
live editor at localhost:8731 — drag things around or restyle there, and hit
Download YAML to keep edits"), not engine internals.
