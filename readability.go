// Readability is the single scene-quality objective of the layout engine
// (docs/design/layout-engine-master-plan.md, Phase 0). It is the contract the
// whole pipeline optimizes toward and the metric every change is gated on, so
// `evaluate` (what it reports) and the renderer (what it optimizes) can no
// longer diverge.
//
// It is computed on the ISO projection, decomposed by affine invariance into:
//   - height-induced, iso-only signals: occlusion (the dominant term);
//   - affine-invariant world-plane signals: crossings, tunnelling, overlaps,
//     bends, length — reused verbatim from the EvaluateIso scorecard, since the
//     iso ground projection preserves them.
//
// Phase 0 wires the existing detectors into one score; later phases complete
// occlusion (bodies/icons) and add aspect/alignment/balance terms.

// ReadabilityReport is the per-scene breakdown plus the scalar score R∈[0,1].
