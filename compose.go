// Composition repair — the acting half of the M2 composition metrics. Where
// RepairScene fixes DEFECTS (occlusion, overlap, contrast), ComposeScene
// improves the positive qualities, starting with the highest-value bounded
// move: snapping off-grid parts onto their neighbours' alignment tracks.
//
// Guarantees (the reason this is safe to run unattended):
//   - only parts that carry an EXPLICIT offset are moved — solver-laid parts
//     are already composed and authors' `place:` relations are never touched;
//   - every snap is bounded (≤ composeMaxSnap world units) and axis-minimal;
//   - a snap that would create a new footprint overlap is reverted, so the
//     defect gates can only stay equal or improve;
//   - deterministic (declared order, fixed passes) and idempotent — a snapped
//     part shares a track, so a second run finds nothing to do.
//
// Opt-in via `isotopo repair --compose [--write]`; persistence rides the same
// diff→set-field machinery as every other repair.
